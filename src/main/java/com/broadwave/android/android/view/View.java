/**
 * <p>
 * This class represents the basic building block for user interface components. A View
 * occupies a rectangular area on the screen and is responsible for drawing and
 * event handling. View is the base class for <em>widgets</em>, which are
 * used to create interactive UI components (buttons, text fields, etc.). The
 * {@link android.view.ViewGroup} subclass is the base class for <em>layouts</em>, which
 * are invisible containers that hold other Views (or other ViewGroups) and define
 * their layout properties.
 * </p>
 *
 * <div class="special reference">
 * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
 * <p>For information about using this class to develop your application's user interface,
 * read the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/ui/index.html">User Interface</a> developer guide.
 * </div>
 *
 * <a name="Using"></a>
 * <h3>Using Views</h3>
 * <p>
 * All of the views in a window are arranged in a single tree. You can add views
 * either from code or by specifying a tree of views in one or more XML layout
 * files. There are many specialized subclasses of views that act as controls or
 * are capable of displaying text, images, or other content.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once you have created a tree of views, there are typically a few types of
 * common operations you may wish to perform:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Set properties:</strong> for example setting the text of a
 * {@link android.widget.TextView}. The available properties and the methods
 * that set them will vary among the different subclasses of views. Note that
 * properties that are known at build time can be set in the XML layout
 * files.</li>
 * <li><strong>Set focus:</strong> The framework will handled moving focus in
 * response to user input. To force focus to a specific view, call
 * {@link #requestFocus}.</li>
 * <li><strong>Set up listeners:</strong> Views allow clients to set listeners
 * that will be notified when something interesting happens to the view. For
 * example, all views will let you set a listener to be notified when the view
 * gains or loses focus. You can register such a listener using
 * {@link #setOnFocusChangeListener(android.view.View.OnFocusChangeListener)}.
 * Other view subclasses offer more specialized listeners. For example, a Button
 * exposes a listener to notify clients when the button is clicked.</li>
 * <li><strong>Set visibility:</strong> You can hide or show views using
 * {@link #setVisibility(int)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p><em>
 * Note: The Android framework is responsible for measuring, laying out and
 * drawing views. You should not call methods that perform these actions on
 * views yourself unless you are actually implementing a
 * {@link android.view.ViewGroup}.
 * </em></p>
 *
 * <a name="Lifecycle"></a>
 * <h3>Implementing a Custom View</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * To implement a custom view, you will usually begin by providing overrides for
 * some of the standard methods that the framework calls on all views. You do
 * not need to override all of these methods. In fact, you can start by just
 * overriding {@link #onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)}.

 *
 * <a name="IDs"></a>
 * <h3>IDs</h3>
 * Views may have an integer id associated with them. These ids are typically
 * assigned in the layout XML files, and are used to find specific views within
 * the view tree. A common pattern is to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Define a Button in the layout file and assign it a unique ID.
 * <pre>
 * &lt;Button
 *     android:id="@+id/my_button"
 *     android:layout_width="wrap_content"
 *     android:layout_height="wrap_content"
 *     android:text="@string/my_button_text"/&gt;
 * </pre></li>
 * <li>From the onCreate method of an Activity, find the Button
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *      Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);
 * </pre></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * View IDs need not be unique throughout the tree, but it is good practice to
 * ensure that they are at least unique within the part of the tree you are
 * searching.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="Position"></a>
 * <h3>Position</h3>
 * <p>
 * The geometry of a view is that of a rectangle. A view has a location,
 * expressed as a pair of <em>left</em> and <em>top</em> coordinates, and
 * two dimensions, expressed as a width and a height. The unit for location
 * and dimensions is the pixel.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is possible to retrieve the location of a view by invoking the methods
 * {@link #getLeft()} and {@link #getTop()}. The former returns the left, or X,
 * coordinate of the rectangle representing the view. The latter returns the
 * top, or Y, coordinate of the rectangle representing the view. These methods
 * both return the location of the view relative to its parent. For instance,
 * when getLeft() returns 20, that means the view is located 20 pixels to the
 * right of the left edge of its direct parent.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition, several convenience methods are offered to avoid unnecessary
 * computations, namely {@link #getRight()} and {@link #getBottom()}.
 * These methods return the coordinates of the right and bottom edges of the
 * rectangle representing the view. For instance, calling {@link #getRight()}
 * is similar to the following computation: <code>getLeft() + getWidth()</code>
 * (see <a href="#SizePaddingMargins">Size</a> for more information about the width.)
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="SizePaddingMargins"></a>
 * <h3>Size, padding and margins</h3>
 * <p>
 * The size of a view is expressed with a width and a height. A view actually
 * possess two pairs of width and height values.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The first pair is known as <em>measured width</em> and
 * <em>measured height</em>. These dimensions define how big a view wants to be
 * within its parent (see <a href="#Layout">Layout</a> for more details.) The
 * measured dimensions can be obtained by calling {@link #getMeasuredWidth()}
 * and {@link #getMeasuredHeight()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The second pair is simply known as <em>width</em> and <em>height</em>, or
 * sometimes <em>drawing width</em> and <em>drawing height</em>. These
 * dimensions define the actual size of the view on screen, at drawing time and
 * after layout. These values may, but do not have to, be different from the
 * measured width and height. The width and height can be obtained by calling
 * {@link #getWidth()} and {@link #getHeight()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To measure its dimensions, a view takes into account its padding. The padding
 * is expressed in pixels for the left, top, right and bottom parts of the view.
 * Padding can be used to offset the content of the view by a specific amount of
 * pixels. For instance, a left padding of 2 will push the view's content by
 * 2 pixels to the right of the left edge. Padding can be set using the
 * {@link #setPadding(int, int, int, int)} or {@link #setPaddingRelative(int, int, int, int)}
 * method and queried by calling {@link #getPaddingLeft()}, {@link #getPaddingTop()},
 * {@link #getPaddingRight()}, {@link #getPaddingBottom()}, {@link #getPaddingStart()},
 * {@link #getPaddingEnd()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Even though a view can define a padding, it does not provide any support for
 * margins. However, view groups provide such a support. Refer to
 * {@link android.view.ViewGroup} and
 * {@link android.view.ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams} for further information.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="Layout"></a>
 * <h3>Layout</h3>
 * <p>
 * Layout is a two pass process: a measure pass and a layout pass. The measuring
 * pass is implemented in {@link #measure(int, int)} and is a top-down traversal
 * of the view tree. Each view pushes dimension specifications down the tree
 * during the recursion. At the end of the measure pass, every view has stored
 * its measurements. The second pass happens in
 * {@link #layout(int,int,int,int)} and is also top-down. During
 * this pass each parent is responsible for positioning all of its children
 * using the sizes computed in the measure pass.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When a view's measure() method returns, its {@link #getMeasuredWidth()} and
 * {@link #getMeasuredHeight()} values must be set, along with those for all of
 * that view's descendants. A view's measured width and measured height values
 * must respect the constraints imposed by the view's parents. This guarantees
 * that at the end of the measure pass, all parents accept all of their
 * children's measurements. A parent view may call measure() more than once on
 * its children. For example, the parent may measure each child once with
 * unspecified dimensions to find out how big they want to be, then call
 * measure() on them again with actual numbers if the sum of all the children's
 * unconstrained sizes is too big or too small.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The measure pass uses two classes to communicate dimensions. The
 * {@link MeasureSpec} class is used by views to tell their parents how they
 * want to be measured and positioned. The base LayoutParams class just
 * describes how big the view wants to be for both width and height. For each
 * dimension, it can specify one of:
 * <ul>
 * <li> an exact number
 * <li>MATCH_PARENT, which means the view wants to be as big as its parent
 * (minus padding)
 * <li> WRAP_CONTENT, which means that the view wants to be just big enough to
 * enclose its content (plus padding).
 * </ul>
 * There are subclasses of LayoutParams for different subclasses of ViewGroup.
 * For example, AbsoluteLayout has its own subclass of LayoutParams which adds
 * an X and Y value.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * MeasureSpecs are used to push requirements down the tree from parent to
 * child. A MeasureSpec can be in one of three modes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>UNSPECIFIED: This is used by a parent to determine the desired dimension
 * of a child view. For example, a LinearLayout may call measure() on its child
 * with the height set to UNSPECIFIED and a width of EXACTLY 240 to find out how
 * tall the child view wants to be given a width of 240 pixels.
 * <li>EXACTLY: This is used by the parent to impose an exact size on the
 * child. The child must use this size, and guarantee that all of its
 * descendants will fit within this size.
 * <li>AT_MOST: This is used by the parent to impose a maximum size on the
 * child. The child must gurantee that it and all of its descendants will fit
 * within this size.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To intiate a layout, call {@link #requestLayout}. This method is typically
 * called by a view on itself when it believes that is can no longer fit within
 * its current bounds.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="Drawing"></a>
 * <h3>Drawing</h3>
 * <p>
 * Drawing is handled by walking the tree and rendering each view that
 * intersects the invalid region. Because the tree is traversed in-order,
 * this means that parents will draw before (i.e., behind) their children, with
 * siblings drawn in the order they appear in the tree.
 * If you set a background drawable for a View, then the View will draw it for you
 * before calling back to its <code>onDraw()</code> method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the framework will not draw views that are not in the invalid region.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To force a view to draw, call {@link #invalidate()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="EventHandlingThreading"></a>
 * <h3>Event Handling and Threading</h3>
 * <p>
 * The basic cycle of a view is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>An event comes in and is dispatched to the appropriate view. The view
 * handles the event and notifies any listeners.</li>
 * <li>If in the course of processing the event, the view's bounds may need
 * to be changed, the view will call {@link #requestLayout()}.</li>
 * <li>Similarly, if in the course of processing the event the view's appearance
 * may need to be changed, the view will call {@link #invalidate()}.</li>
 * <li>If either {@link #requestLayout()} or {@link #invalidate()} were called,
 * the framework will take care of measuring, laying out, and drawing the tree
 * as appropriate.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><em>Note: The entire view tree is single threaded. You must always be on
 * the UI thread when calling any method on any view.</em>
 * If you are doing work on other threads and want to update the state of a view
 * from that thread, you should use a {@link Handler}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="FocusHandling"></a>
 * <h3>Focus Handling</h3>
 * <p>
 * The framework will handle routine focus movement in response to user input.
 * This includes changing the focus as views are removed or hidden, or as new
 * views become available. Views indicate their willingness to take focus
 * through the {@link #isFocusable} method. To change whether a view can take
 * focus, call {@link #setFocusable(boolean)}.  When in touch mode (see notes below)
 * views indicate whether they still would like focus via {@link #isFocusableInTouchMode}
 * and can change this via {@link #setFocusableInTouchMode(boolean)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Focus movement is based on an algorithm which finds the nearest neighbor in a
 * given direction. In rare cases, the default algorithm may not match the
 * intended behavior of the developer. In these situations, you can provide
 * explicit overrides by using these XML attributes in the layout file:
 * <pre>
 * nextFocusDown
 * nextFocusLeft
 * nextFocusRight
 * nextFocusUp
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * To get a particular view to take focus, call {@link #requestFocus()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="TouchMode"></a>
 * <h3>Touch Mode</h3>
 * <p>
 * When a user is navigating a user interface via directional keys such as a D-pad, it is
 * necessary to give focus to actionable items such as buttons so the user can see
 * what will take input.  If the device has touch capabilities, however, and the user
 * begins interacting with the interface by touching it, it is no longer necessary to
 * always highlight, or give focus to, a particular view.  This motivates a mode
 * for interaction named 'touch mode'.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For a touch capable device, once the user touches the screen, the device
 * will enter touch mode.  From this point onward, only views for which
 * {@link #isFocusableInTouchMode} is true will be focusable, such as text editing widgets.
 * Other views that are touchable, like buttons, will not take focus when touched; they will
 * only fire the on click listeners.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any time a user hits a directional key, such as a D-pad direction, the view device will
 * exit touch mode, and find a view to take focus, so that the user may resume interacting
 * with the user interface without touching the screen again.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The touch mode state is maintained across {@link android.app.Activity}s.  Call
 * {@link #isInTouchMode} to see whether the device is currently in touch mode.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="Scrolling"></a>
 * <h3>Scrolling</h3>
 * <p>
 * The framework provides basic support for views that wish to internally
 * scroll their content. This includes keeping track of the X and Y scroll
 * offset as well as mechanisms for drawing scrollbars. See
 * {@link #scrollBy(int, int)}, {@link #scrollTo(int, int)}, and
 * {@link #awakenScrollBars()} for more details.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="Tags"></a>
 * <h3>Tags</h3>
 * <p>
 * Unlike IDs, tags are not used to identify views. Tags are essentially an
 * extra piece of information that can be associated with a view. They are most
 * often used as a convenience to store data related to views in the views
 * themselves rather than by putting them in a separate structure.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="Properties"></a>
 * <h3>Properties</h3>
 * <p>
 * The View class exposes an {@link #ALPHA} property, as well as several transform-related
 * properties, such as {@link #TRANSLATION_X} and {@link #TRANSLATION_Y}. These properties are
 * available both in the {@link Property} form as well as in similarly-named setter/getter
 * methods (such as {@link #setAlpha(float)} for {@link #ALPHA}). These properties can
 * be used to set persistent state associated with these rendering-related properties on the view.
 * The properties and methods can also be used in conjunction with
 * {@link android.animation.Animator Animator}-based animations, described more in the
 * <a href="#Animation">Animation</a> section.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="Animation"></a>
 * <h3>Animation</h3>
 * <p>
 * Starting with Android 3.0, the preferred way of animating views is to use the
 * {@link android.animation} package APIs. These {@link android.animation.Animator Animator}-based
 * classes change actual properties of the View object, such as {@link #setAlpha(float) alpha} and
 * {@link #setTranslationX(float) translationX}. This behavior is contrasted to that of the pre-3.0
 * {@link android.view.animation.Animation Animation}-based classes, which instead animate only
 * how the view is drawn on the display. In particular, the {@link ViewPropertyAnimator} class
 * makes animating these View properties particularly easy and efficient.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, you can use the pre-3.0 animation classes to animate how Views are rendered.
 * You can attach an {@link Animation} object to a view using
 * {@link #setAnimation(Animation)} or
 * {@link #startAnimation(Animation)}. The animation can alter the scale,
 * rotation, translation and alpha of a view over time. If the animation is
 * attached to a view that has children, the animation will affect the entire
 * subtree rooted by that node. When an animation is started, the framework will
 * take care of redrawing the appropriate views until the animation completes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="Security"></a>
 * <h3>Security</h3>
 * <p>
 * Sometimes it is essential that an application be able to verify that an action
 * is being performed with the full knowledge and consent of the user, such as
 * granting a permission request, making a purchase or clicking on an advertisement.
 * Unfortunately, a malicious application could try to spoof the user into
 * performing these actions, unaware, by concealing the intended purpose of the view.
 * As a remedy, the framework offers a touch filtering mechanism that can be used to
 * improve the security of views that provide access to sensitive functionality.
 * </p><p>
 * To enable touch filtering, call {@link #setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(boolean)} or set the
 * android:filterTouchesWhenObscured layout attribute to true.  When enabled, the framework
 * will discard touches that are received whenever the view's window is obscured by
 * another visible window.  As a result, the view will not receive touches whenever a
 * toast, dialog or other window appears above the view's window.
 * </p><p>
 * For more fine-grained control over security, consider overriding the
 * {@link #onFilterTouchEventForSecurity(MotionEvent)} method to implement your own
 * security policy. See also {@link MotionEvent#FLAG_WINDOW_IS_OBSCURED}.

     * <p>This has the same visual effect as

     * WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN},
     * meaning that non-critical screen decorations (such as the status bar) will be

     * Window.FEATURE_ACTION_BAR_OVERLAY}, then enabling this flag will also
     * hide the action bar.

     * <p>This approach to going fullscreen is best used over the window flag when
     * it is a transient state -- that is, the application does this at certain
     * points in its user interaction where it wants to allow the user to focus
     * on content, but not as a continuous state.  For situations where the application

     * the other system UI states.

     * for the user to go out of it.  A common example would be in an e-book
     * reader, where tapping on the screen brings back whatever screen and UI
     * decorations that had been hidden while the user was immersed in reading

     * will always represent the worst case that the application can expect
     * as a continuous state.  In the stock Android UI this is the space for
     * the system bar, nav bar, and status bar, but not more transient elements
     * such as an input method.
     *
     * The stable layout your UI sees is based on the system UI modes you can
